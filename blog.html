        <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold text-[30px]">var:</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px]">When we use "var", we can change the values of its variables and declare it at any time because it exists throughout the whole program.</p>
        <br><hr>
        <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold text-[30px]">let:</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px]">In this "let" case, we can change the value of the variable but we cannot create a new one because it is blocked in the overall program.</p>
        <br><hr>
        <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold text-[30px]">const:</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px]">This "const" cannot be changed or declared again because it can only be used inside a specific part of the code.</p>
        <br><hr>
        <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold text-[30px]">use cases of null:</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px]">The "null" means that there is intentionally no value.we can use the value "null" to show that a variable has been set but doesn't currently have a value.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1.we can specifically set variables to null to show that there is no value</li>
            <li>2.we can remove the values of object properties that they should not have any value anymore by setting them to null.</li>
            <li>3.A function can give back null if it didn't give a valid result.</li>
            <li>4.Sometimes, we can use "null" to remove or manage things like event listeners.</li>
            <li>5.The default value for optional parameters can be set as null.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><hr>
        <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold text-[30px]">use cases of undefined:</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px]">Undefined means that the variable has been named, but it doesn't have a value yet.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1.Default function parameters allow us to use an "undefined" value as a default for function parameters. This helps to deal with situations where the caller doesn't provide a value for a parameter.</li>
            <li>2.we can find out if a variable exists by comparing it to the value "undefined. " This is often used to check if a variable has been created or given a value.</li>
            <li>3.To check if a property exists when dealing with objects, we can access the property and see if the result is undefined.</li>
            <li>4.If a function doesn't give a specific result, it will automatically give an undefined result.</li>
            <li>5.Array elements that are missing or have not been given a value are known as undefined.</li>
    </ol>

        <h3 class="my-2 font-semibold text-[30px]">about REST API:</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px]">A REST API is a set of rules that allow software applications to communicate with each other over the internet using a common language called HTTP. It has some rules, like not keeping track of past events, using links that represent things, and using common ways of talking to servers, like getting, adding, changing, and removing information. REST APIs are a way to get and control resources. They are known for being simple, easy to use, and work well with different programs. People like to use REST APIs to create web services and facilitate communication between software systems.</p>
